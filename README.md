This is a single page application which shows new album and single releases. The app made with React.js framwork.

We made 5 components and mounted three of them (CoverImg, AlbumName & ArtistName) to AlbumList.jsx, and then we import Header and AlbumList to App.jsx.
We have one cover image and Album name and Artist name.
In the album we made a link to Spotify. And by Hovering on the cover image the icons are displaying.
The play icon has an extra hovering effect (transform: scale(1.1)), making it bigger.
The app is responsive showing 4 albums per row on desktop, 2 per row on tablet and 1 per row on mobile.
The problem
Making props and connecting all files to the app and map function one of the biggest issues we struggled with. And for the CSS part, hovering and icons was not easy neither.

If we had more time we would work on making the images responsive in terms of what images to actually show, for example in phone size use the smallest images and bigger for bigger screen sizes (since there was three different images for each album/single).
